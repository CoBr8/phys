    "In the `data` directory you find a data file with surface properties a model star with a mass 20 times that of the sun, as a function of time. The header describes that the colums are. Open the file and have a look. Recall that you can turn any code cell into a bash cell with the command `%%bash` in the first line. One-line bash commands, such as `cat` or `head` will be understood even without that in a regular python code cell.\n",
