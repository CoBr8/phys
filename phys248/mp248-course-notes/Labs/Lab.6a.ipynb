    "As a variant of this morning's lecture, write a function that takes as input a directory.  The function will search through that directory and its full subdirectory tree, building a count of the files by their extensions.  As in the lecture, use a dictionary to keep track of the counts. The return-value of this function will be a dictionary of (key,value) pairs where the key will be the file extension and the value will be the number of files with that extension.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, for the file \"script.py\", the extension is \".py\".  The return value of your function will be a dictionary of the form **{ \".py\" : 50, \".exe\" : 15, etc }** provided there are 50 python scripts and 15 exe files in the subdirectory tree. If a file has no extension (eg: the file named \"README\") store the extension as \"<NONE>\".  We consider the extension to be the information after the rightmost period in the file name.\n",
