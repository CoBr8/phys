    "## P2 : Simple Equation Solver\n",
    "\n",
    "While Newton's method is an excellent way to solve equations, in practice there is a more reliable way to solve equations, called the **subdivision method**. \n",
    "\n",
    "The heart of the subdivision method is the **intermediate value theorem** which states that if a function $f: [a,b] \\to \\mathbb R$ is *continuous* then for any $y_0$ between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ (not equal to $f(a)$ or $f(b)$), there exists $t_0 \\in (a,b)$ with $f(t_0) = y_0$. This theorem is the inspiration for:\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Subdivision method** for solving $f(t)=0$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given a continuous function $f : [a,b] \\to \\mathbb R$ with $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ having opposite signs (in particular, not zero), let $t_0$ be the *mid-point* of the interval $[a,b]$ i.e. $t_0 = \\frac{a+b}{2}$.  We know by the intermediate value theorem that $f(t)=0$ has a solution in the interval.  Moreover, if $f(t_0)$ has the same sign as $f(b)$, then by the intermediate value theorem, a solution *must be* in the interval $[a,t_0]$.  Similarly, if $f(t_0)$ has the same sign as $f(a)$, a solution *must be* in the interval $[t_0,b]$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The *subdivision method* is to repeat this process of replacing the interval $[a,b]$ by either $[a,t_0]$ or $[t_0,b]$ until your interval is shorter than your acceptable error in approximation. \n",
    "\n",
    "**The problem** Write a Python function *subdiv(f,x,a,b,eps)* that takes as input a sympy function $f$ with variable $x$, with left endpoint $a$ and right endpoint $b$. *eps* is your acceptable amount of error.  The function subdiv will iterate the subdivision method until the interval containing a root is shorter than *eps*.  The function will return the endpoints of the interval, together with the number of iterations.  Find the root of $x^x-2$ in the interval $[1,2]$.  Set $eps = \\frac{1}{10^k}$ for $k=1,2,3,4,5,6$, printing the output of *subdiv* in each case.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint** When solving for the root of $x^x-2$, using endpoints $1.0$ and $2.0$ with *eps=0.5*, *subdiv* should take only one iteration. Using *eps=1.0* it should take zero."
