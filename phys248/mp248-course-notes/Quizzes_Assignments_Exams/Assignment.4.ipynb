    "a) For each city, and each month, compute the average of: daily max, min and mean temperatures for that month.  In more concrete detail: for Edmonton January max temperatures, you would take the average of all the maximum temperatures for every day in January, for all years in which we have data, for the city of Edmonton.  You would do the same for every month, and all three temperature readings (daily max, min, mean).  Output your answer as four $12 \\times 3$ numpy matrices. \n",

    "b) For every city, and every weather reading (daily max, min, mean), find the weather record where that daily temperature recording differs from the monthly average by the largest amount. i.e. your answer to part (b) will consist of **12** weather records. Please format your answer so that you have your **12=4*3** answers on one line each. For example, one line would be:\n",

TMP is the temperature reading on that day (in this case, the daily mean temp).  AVG is the average of the temperature readings for month MM.  DEV is the difference between TMP and AVG, i.e. DEV = TMP-AVG. "
