# Core materials

This documents describes the core material of this course. Students who master these skills reliably possess  adequate comprehension of the course material and the skills needed to work with the course material. Mastery of these skills meets the basic requirements for completing assigned work and/or participating in class activities.

## Command line, git, bash
* analysing a text file using command line bash tools, such as searching and replacing strings, counting occurrences
* bash commands to manipulate files on the command line,  such `rm`, `cp`, `mv`, `cd`
* writing and executing of simple shell scripts 
* git: add, commit, pull, push, basic operations to interact with the course repository and with your own repository

## Basic python
* an understanding of the namespaces concept in python
* python data types: list, float, integer, string, dictionary.
* flow control: if, for, while, statements.
* strings: concatenation, splitting, slicing.
* list: iterating through and slicing lists, sorting
* dict: creating dictionaries, iterating through dictionaries
* formatted printing
* reading and writing text files: open(), read(), readlines(), write(), close()
* procedural programming: creating and using functions, return values.

## Python libraries
* basic numpy functions
    - for example `sqrt`, trigonometric functions
    - arrays in 1D and 2D
    - manipulating matrices [like what? transpose? shaping?]
    - file I/O with loadtxt
    - basic linear algebra like solving systems of equations, dot product etc 
* matplotlib.pyplot
    - figure, point plots, scatter plots, line plots, pie charts, bar plots and histograms, contour plots
    - effective plotting (titles, axis labels, legends, clear presentation)
* units and constants package
* sympy: manipulating, simplifying formal mathematical expressions, evalf(), lambdify, substitution, solve(), 
* datetime: basic manipulations of dates, datetime and timedelta objects.
* requests: get() command for downloading files on the web
* os: getcwd() to know the current working directory for your Python script.

## Applications
* solving systems of ODEs using scipy libraries
* interpolation of 1D (x,y) data sets
* numerical differentiation and integration of 1D functions f(x)
* analysis of large datasets: plotting, least square approximation (such as in the weather and crime data modules)
