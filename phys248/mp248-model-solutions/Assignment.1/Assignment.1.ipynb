    "* For low precision, such as `float16` the rounding errors dominate if more than $\\approx 100$ rectangles are used.\n",
    "* For medium precision, such as `float32` the rounding errors dominate if more than $\\approx 10^4$ rectangles are used.\n",
    "*  With `float64` truncation errors are decreasing down to very small rectangle sizes with $\\Delta x \\approx 10^{-7}$\n",
    "* Using `npow_max = 8` with `float64` will crash the kernel because the amount of memory for this vectorized calculation is exceeded. In the model solution above the array `x=linspace(0,a,int(10**n)+1,dtype=precision)` uses the following amount of memory (for `npow_max = 8` with `float64`)"

    "If higher accuracy has to be obtained the vector operation is replaced by a loop. Then the memory requirements remain very low, but now a sequential loop has to be executed many times. The new limitation now is computing time. A further improvement could be a combination of both approaches, making a loop of vector operations with vectors reasonably large."
