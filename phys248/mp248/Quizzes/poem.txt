Learning From Mistakes

I have finally come to the place
Where things can come off the shelf
So I can try to learn from mistakes
And not be so hard on myself.

I no longer need to be opaque
It's time for me to see
That my failures and past mistakes
Do not label me.

No longer trusting what used to assure
Sorting out things that will last
Mistakes filter out what really endures
Permitting to learn from the past.

I know life has its ups and downs
I can't help things don't go to plan
But mistakes no longer bring 'that frown'
Now that I know who I am.
