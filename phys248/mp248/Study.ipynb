    "## General steps involved in a computational physics problem\n",
    "From this example we can identify the following steps involved in solving a computational physics problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identify clearly the question.\n",
    "   - this may sound like a trivial step, but in practise a lot of confusion later on can be avoided if the question or problem to be addressed is very clearly defined\n",
    "2. Identify the relevant and important physics that needs to be considered. \n",
    "    - if the problem does not have radiation or magnetic fields, then don't include them; again this sounds trivial but still ...\n",
    "3. Formulate the physics in an appropriate mathematical framework.\n",
    "4. Chose a suitable difference scheme to represent the mathematical equation.\n",
    "    - this step determines the numerical accuracy of the scheme\n",
    "    - it says how well do the difference equations represent the mathematical equations\n",
    "5. Chose the right solution scheme for the difference equation.\n",
    "    - this will effect the stability of the numerical solution\n",
    "    - it will determine how precisely the adopted solution represents the difference equation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Precision and accuracy\n",
    "* lack of precision is due to round-off errors\n",
    "* lack od accurcay is due to truncation errors\n",
    "Accuracy increases with higher numerical (time or spatial) resolution until the round-off errors dominate.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Verification and validation\n",
    "A very important final step that often takes significant amount of time and effort is to _check if we get the right answer for the right reasons_. We need to do answer to fundamental questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Have I solved the right equations? This test is called **validation**.\n",
    "2. Have I solved the equations right? This is called **verification**.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important verification test is a numerical convergence study as well as comparison against analytical solutions. The only real validation test is the comparison with experimental data.\n",
