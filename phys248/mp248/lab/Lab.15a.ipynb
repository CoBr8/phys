    "    - Create one set of 11 points that lie on the x-axis (y=0) for $x \\in [0,1]$.\n",
    "    - Now use the rotation transformation to create the perpendicular point set that lies on the y-axis.\n",
    "    - Create the two missing point sets by just shifting each of the already existing points by 1 in the approriate way. \n",
    "2. Make a plot of the square and give points belonging to each side a different color and symbol. Connect the points with different types of broken lines.\n",
    "3. Apply the horizintal shear transformation with a shear parameter $m=1$. Plot the transformed point set.\n",
    "4. Apply the rotation  transformation with $\\Theta = 45\\deg$ in the counterclockwise direction. Plot the transformed point set."
